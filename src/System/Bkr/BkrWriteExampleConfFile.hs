If you choose to run bkr in synchronization mode please be sure that you understand what this means. For instance, if you for some reason happen to remove the folders you are backing up with bkr by accident and then run bkr all backed up files will also be removed and you will not be able to use the bkr backup to restore the files. synchronizationmode: no is recommended.\nsynchronizationmode: no\n\n# Use S3 reduced redundancy (yes or no). Please read http://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/#What_is_RRS for more information but if the data you are backing up is critical choose no.\nuses3reducedredundancy: no\n\n# File update check algorithm. There are three ways Bkr can determine if a uploaded (backed up) file is the same as a local file or if the local file has been updated. By checksum (safest but slowest), by change date (fastest and safe if you trust you filesystem time stamps) and smart (checksum is guaranteed to be checked every tenth run but the chance of the checksum beeing checked gets 10% higher for every run). Valid choices are: checksum (not recommended unless you need to be sure that the uploaded and local files are the same, will be slow for many and big files), date (recommended if you trust your filesystem timestamps) and smart (the recommended level)\n#fileupdatecheck: checksum\nfileupdatecheck: smart\n#fileupdatecheck: date\n\n# Log file location. Set a location of the log file. Default is $HOME/.bkr.log where $HOME is replaced with your home directory.\nlogfilelocation: $HOME/.bkr.log\n\n# Set maximum size in bytes of the log file. The log file is rotated after the size limit is reached. Default size is 5MB\nlogfilemaximumsize: 5242880\n\n# Valid log levels are: debug (verbose logginig), notify (notifications and errors, the recommended level), critical (only errors)\n#loglevel: debug\nloglevel: notify\n#loglevel: critical"
